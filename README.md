The Secure QR Code Scanner project aims to provide a reliable and efficient solution to detect malicious or unsafe QR codes, enhancing user security when scanning QR codes in everyday life. The core machine learning model, responsible for analyzing and classifying QR codes, was developed collaboratively by the team, involving data collection, feature engineering, and model training to ensure high accuracy and robustness. To make the model easily accessible and scalable, we integrated it with Hugging Face’s model hosting platform, allowing seamless deployment and inference through their API. The application combines this powerful backend with a user-friendly interface, providing a secure and smooth scanning experience
## 📌 Features

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/DivyashreeGP/Secure-QR-code-Scanner.git
cd Secure-QR-code-Scanner

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/Mac

### 3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Run the application

python qr_scanner.py

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The app scans QR codes using your webcam.
2. Extracted URL is sent to a **phishing detection model** hosted on Hugging Face.
3. The model returns the prediction (safe or malicious).
4. The user is notified instantly via popup alerts.

> 🔒 This ensures better security when scanning unknown QR codes.

### 🚀 Features

- 📸 **Live Camera Scan** using ZXing
- 🖼️ **Image Upload Mode** for scanning QR codes from files
- ⚠️ **Smart Threat Detection & Redirection**:
  - 🔴 Blocks redirection for highly malicious URLs
  - 🟠 Asks user confirmation for suspicious links
  - 🟡 Warns and redirects for moderately risky URLs
  - 🟢 Directly redirects safe URLs
- 🧠 Powered by an **ONNX phishing URL detection model**
- 💡 Clean and responsive UI with **Dark Mode**
